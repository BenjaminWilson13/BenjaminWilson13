### Hi there 👋

I worked as a truck driver for about 8 years until I needed to make a change. I became a student at AppAcademy and learned more than I ever thought I could in such a short time period. 

My time as a truck driver taught me how to be a self motivator. No one looks over your shoulder in the cab of a truck so it's up to you to make sure you run on time and make the miles you need to make. 

I also learned how to identify things that would affect my schedule and report to my dispatch was as much information as I could gather. Things like: 
🚛 How late I would be
🚛 The route with major cities along the way in case they could have me swap loads with another driver, and a general breakdown of what caused the delay 
🚛 Why my current driving hours wouldn't allow for on time delivery

During my time at AppAcademy I've learned how to create full stack project, both as a solo developer and as a member of a team. 

⭐The first project I worked on: https://meetup-clone-project-n8eu.onrender.com
This was built using an express backend and react-redux front end. This was the first time I used the skills I had been developing to actually create something real. It's not as polished as my later projects, but was an important step in my growth as a developer. 

🌟The second project: https://discordia-dz4f.onrender.com/
This was the first time put the skills I developed during the first project to use. I became faster at creating backend routes in Flask with SQAlchemy and components in React-Redux. The group dynamic was very different from working as a solo developer but I found that I prefer to working as part of a group on a single project rather than working alone. If you take the time to look at any of my projects, this is the one to check out! 

⭐The third project: https://customey.onrender.com
This is where everything fully came together. My code became much cleaner and easier to read. I was able to create more than one or two components per day and made much, much faster progress on this project than I ever envisioned I could during the first two. While not as complicated as my group project, my coding style and skill are on full display here.
